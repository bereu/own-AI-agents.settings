description: Use this skill to ensure code quality by validating features against acceptance criteria, generating edge-case tests, and running verification suites.

## Overview

This skill facilitates a thorough Quality Assurance process for new features or bug fixes. It focuses on translating high-level Acceptance Criteria (AC) into executable tests (using Vitest for unit/integration and Playwright for E2E) and identifying potential failure points that may have been overlooked during development.

## Core Activities

1.  **AC-to-Test Mapping**: Analyze the `docs/exec-plans/` or specific task requirements to extract all Acceptance Criteria. For each AC, identify the corresponding test file and test case.
2.  **Edge Case Identification**: Systematically check for:
    *   Boundary conditions (min/max values, empty strings, nulls).
    *   Network failure scenarios (retry logic, timeouts).
    *   Concurrent state mutations (multiple session workers).
    *   Security constraints (path traversal, secret leakage).
3.  **Verification Run**: Execute the test suite and confirm all tests pass before moving a plan to "completed".
4.  **E2E testing**: Please verify if does the feature run correctly or not with chrome dev tools MCP.

## Mandatory Rules

*   **Environment Isolation**: Tests must never share state or interfere with a running production/dev environment.
*   **Report Failures Clearly**: If a feature fails verification, provide a structured report of which AC failed and why.
